## how it works?

we use a [smart contract](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0xdbd534c712b9fbafced7343a273989adf8e25856) to detemine the winner.
this is semi-permissionless. anyone can add prize to the contract. but oopslotto.xyz will only PR project that fill this [form](https://forms.gle/oPtDVEjF5ucS2Y1S6) and maybe answer some question. 
however, prize payout are not control by oopslotto.xyz team. we'll will verify the payout and add to either winner list or rug list.
